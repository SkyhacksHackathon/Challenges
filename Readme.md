How can I win?
------------

You have to make a model using any available technology on your choice, which beats results of another teams! 
> Remember to make repository with your winning solution public until Saturday, 27.10.2019 13.00, so we can accept it. Solutions with private repositories will be skipped!

 
Where can I send answers?
------------
Main [Dashboard](https://judge.skygate.io/) with live results.

To send us your solution you have:
1. Register your team.
2. Send validation .csv file in proper format (so our Scorer can accept it) to begin a task.
3. Solve and send us .csv file with your answer, we will validate it, and show a final score for your solution. 

> **NOTE:** use **;** as .csv separator!

> You can send answers 1 time every 15 minutes.


 
Butâ€¦ my laptop works like calculator, how can I speed up learning my models?
------------
This year we propose to use 3 solutions where you can collaborate with your teammates and make learning process fast and fun using GPU:

* [Kaggle Kernels](https://www.kaggle.com/kernels)
* [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb#)
* [Azure Notebooks](https://notebooks.azure.com/)
 
Each of these solutions can be empowered by GPU computational resource. 

>Remember to keep your notebooks private!
